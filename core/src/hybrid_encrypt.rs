//! Hybrid encryption.

/// `HybridEncrypt` is the interface for hybrid encryption.
///
/// Hybrid Encryption combines the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the convenience of
/// public-key encryption: to encrypt a message a fresh symmetric key is generated and used to
/// encrypt the actual plaintext data, while the recipientâ€™s public key is used to encrypt the
/// symmetric key only, and the final ciphertext consists of the symmetric ciphertext and the
/// encrypted symmetric key.
///
/// ## WARNING
///
/// Hybrid Encryption does not provide authenticity, that is the recipient of an encrypted message
/// does not know the identity of the sender. Similar to general public-key encryption schemes the
/// security goal of Hybrid Encryption is to provide privacy only. In other words, Hybrid Encryption
/// is secure if and only if the recipient can accept anonymous messages or can rely on other
/// mechanisms to authenticate the sender.
///
/// ## Security guarantees
///
/// The functionality of Hybrid Encryption is represented as a pair of primitives (traits):
/// `HybridEncrypt` for encryption of data, and `HybridDecrypt` for decryption.
/// Implementations of these traits are secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks. In
/// addition to plaintext the encryption takes an extra parameter `context_info`, which
/// usually is public data implicit from the context, but should be bound to the resulting
/// ciphertext, i.e. the ciphertext allows for checking the integrity of `context_info` (but
/// there are no guarantees wrt. the secrecy or authenticity of `context_info`).
///
/// `context_info` can be empty, but to ensure the correct decryption of a ciphertext
/// the same value must be provided for the decryption operation as was used during encryption (cf.
/// `HybridDecrypt`).
///
/// A concrete implementation of this trait can implement the binding of contextInfo to
/// the ciphertext in various ways, for example:
///
/// - use `context_info` as "associated data"-input for the employed AEAD symmetric encryption (cf.
///   [RFC 5116](ttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5116)).
/// - use `context_info` as "CtxInfo"-input for HKDF (if the implementation uses HKDF as key
///   derivation function, cf. [RFC 5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869)).
